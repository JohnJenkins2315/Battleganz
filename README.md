# Battleganz
This is my company's repository. 
I incorporated for the first time on May 3rd of 2019. The name of the company was Battleganz LLC. 
It was a game design company. Two months later, I dissolved the company (for an excellent reason) and decided that
I would have to find a new way to start a business. One programming language that I had always wanted to learn was
Ruby (Perl as well). I decide, after years of delay, to check out a book on Ruby. It was so elegant and concise. 
I immediately made my first Ruby game. It was maniacly simple, but it showed that I could put a coherent experience together. 
The fun part was tracking down the bugs. I showed the first Ruby game to a friend of mine and he made suggestions. I wanted to 
make the sequel even better. Basically, I want to fill this repository with game art and game programming, also game stories. 
I can use this for my programming future. I love Dropbox, but this is better for programming.
